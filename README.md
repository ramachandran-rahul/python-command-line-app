# python-command-line-app

Language Tool CLI - A comprehensive Python-based command-line tool designed for managing and processing language data efficiently. This tool leverages a robust Python script that allows users to perform a variety of operations on text files containing language names, ISO codes, and character sets. The script supports multiple command-line options:

-a: Lists all language names from the file in alphabetical order.
-c [code]: Searches for a specific language based on its two-character ISO code.
-s [set]: Filters languages by character sets and lists matching entries.
-v: Displays author credentials and submission details.

The script ensures rigorous error handling for file accessibility issues and argument validation, providing clear error messages for common file-related errors such as non-existent, unreadable, or improperly formatted files. Ideal for users needing to quickly access and sort language-related information stored in text files.
